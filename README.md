# 🚀 Delivery Aggregator Platform

> Welcome to the team! We're building Southeast Asia's most intelligent delivery platform, and we're excited to have you on board.

## 🌟 What We're Building

Or perhaps you're a family grocery store in Bangkok, taking your first steps into online delivery. These are real stories of our users, and we're here to make their lives easier.

We're building an intelligent delivery aggregator that:
- Simplifies logistics for Southeast Asian merchants
- Integrates multiple delivery services seamlessly
- Makes smart decisions about delivery options
- Helps businesses grow and succeed
