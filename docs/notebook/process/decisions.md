# Engineering Decisions & Rationale

Our development journey is shaped by careful consideration of technical choices and their impact. Here's how we're building Antar's foundation.

## Bulk Upload Architecture

    subgraph "Processing Strategy"
    A[Client Processing] -->|Benefits| B[Instant Feedback]
    A -->|Benefits| C[Reduced Server Load]
    A -->|Benefits| D[Offline Support]
    
    A -->|Challenges| E[Browser Limits]
    A -->|Challenges| F[Memory Constraints]
    end
    
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style B fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Route Optimization Approach

    subgraph "Current Implementation"
    A[Straight-Line Distance] -->|Simple| B[Quick Development]
    A -->|Clear| C[Easy Understanding]
    A -->|Flexible| D[MVP Ready]
    end
    
    subgraph "Future Enhancement"
    E[Real Routes] -->|Complex| F[Road Conditions]
    E -->|Accurate| G[Traffic Patterns]
    end
    
    style A fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style E fill:#f99,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Implementation Timeline

## Technical Evolution

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Current State"
    A[Simple Distance] --> B[Basic Groups]
    B --> C[Manual Adjustments]
    end
    
    subgraph "Next Phase"
    D[Real Routes] --> E[Smart Groups]
    E --> F[Auto Optimization]
    end
    
    A -.->|Evolution| D
    B -.->|Evolution| E
    C -.->|Evolution| F
    
    style A fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Through these decisions, we're building a foundation that balances immediate needs with future scalability. Our choices prioritize user experience while maintaining technical excellence.
