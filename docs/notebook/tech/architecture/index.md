# Technical Architecture Specification

## System Overview
Core delivery management system with emphasis on efficient bulk order processing and route optimization.

## Component Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
  - File-based routing implementation
  - Server components for performance-critical operations
  - API routes for geocoding services

### Core Services
1. Map Visualization
   - Implementation: Leaflet
   - Purpose: Route display and optimization interface
   - Performance: Client-side rendering with layer optimization

2. Data Processing
   - CSV Parsing: PapaParse
   - Computation: Web Workers for non-blocking operations
   - Route Optimization: Client-side algorithms

## System Design Principles

### Architecture Decisions
1. Client-Side Processing
   - Rationale: Reduced server load, immediate feedback
   - Trade-offs: Browser capability dependencies
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement

2. Mobile-First Implementation
   - Responsive design patterns
   - Touch-optimized interactions
   - Bandwidth-conscious data loading

3. Offline Capabilities
   - Service worker implementation
   - Local storage optimization
   - State synchronization protocols

4. Real-Time Updates
   - WebSocket consideration for future scaling
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Conflict resolution strategies

## Performance Specifications

### Optimization Targets
- Initial load: < 2s
- CSV processing: 1000 rows/sec
- Route calculation: O(n log n)

### Monitoring Metrics
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Processing throughput
- Memory utilization

## Scaling Considerations
- Horizontal scaling preparation
- Database integration points
- Caching strategy
- Load balancing requirements

## Future Architecture Components
1. Backend Services (When Required)
   - API Gateway
   - Microservices structure
   - Data persistence layer

2. Infrastructure
   - CDN integration
   - Geographic distribution
   - Failover mechanisms
