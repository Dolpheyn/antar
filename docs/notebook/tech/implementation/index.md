## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up and working with the Antar delivery management system. We'll cover everything from initial setup to development best practices.

### Quick Start

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Setup WSL2] --> B[Install Tools]
    B --> C[Clone Project]
    C --> D[Run Dev Server]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style D fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

1. [Set up your development environment](./development-environment.md)
2. [Configure the project](./project-setup.md)
3. Start developing!

## Project Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Frontend Layer"
        A[Pages] --> B[Components]
        B --> C[Libraries]
    end
    
    subgraph "Core Features"
        D[Bulk Upload] --> E[Route Planning]
        E --> F[Delivery Management]
    end
    
    subgraph "Infrastructure"
        G[Development] --> H[Testing]
        H --> I[Deployment]
    end
    
    C --> D
    F --> G
    
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style D fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style G fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
- WSL2 Ubuntu configuration
- Node.js and package management
- Development tools and extensions

### 2. Project Structure
- Next.js application layout
- Component organization
- Feature implementation

### 3. Development Process
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Code] --> B[Test]
    B --> C[Review]
    C --> D[Deploy]
    D --> A
```

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Feature-based structure
- Shared components
- Utility libraries

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for features
- End-to-end testing

### Performance Optimization
- Code splitting
- Image optimization
- Caching strategies

## Next Steps
1. [Set up your development environment](./development-environment.md)
2. [Configure your project](./project-setup.md)
3. Review our [coding standards](../architecture/index.md)
4. Start building features!
