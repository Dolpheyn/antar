## üß© System Components

### 1. CSV Ingestion & Validation Layer
```go
type DeliveryRecord struct {
    DeliveryID    string
    PickupLat     float64 `validate:"required,latitude"`
    PickupLon     float64 `validate:"required,longitude"`
    DropoffLat    float64 `validate:"required,latitude"`
    DropoffLon    float64 `validate:"required,longitude"`
}

// Zero-allocation, high-performance parsing
func (s *Service) ParseAndValidateBulkDeliveries(csvReader io.Reader) ([]DeliveryRecord, error) {
    // Streaming validation
    // Minimal memory allocation
    // Parallel processing potential
}
```

### 2. Routing Engine Architecture
```go
type RouteOptimizer struct {
    primaryEngine   *OSRMRouter
    fallbackEngine  *GoogleMapsRouter
    cachingLayer    *RedisCache
}

func (ro *RouteOptimizer) OptimizeRoutes(deliveries []DeliveryRecord) ([]Route, error) {
    // Intelligent routing provider selection
    // Caching optimization results
    // Fallback mechanism implementation
}
```

### 3. Clustering Strategy
```go
type GeographicClusterer struct {
    // Custom clustering algorithm
    // Considers route continuity
    // Learns from historical data
}

func (gc *GeographicClusterer) ClusterDeliveries(deliveries []DeliveryRecord) []DeliveryCluster {
    // Adaptive clustering logic
    // Beyond simple radius-based grouping
}
```
