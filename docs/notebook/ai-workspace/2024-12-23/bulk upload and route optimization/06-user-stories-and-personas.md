## User Stories

### Bulk Upload and Initial Processing
1. As Maria, I want to upload my daily delivery list quickly
   - **Given** I have a CSV file with delivery locations
   - **When** I upload the file
   - **Then** I should receive immediate validation feedback
     * Validate all delivery IDs
     * Check latitude/longitude accuracy
     * Show me which rows have errors
     * Allow partial upload of valid entries

2. As Carlos, I need a clear overview of my uploaded deliveries
   - **Given** I've uploaded a delivery list
   - **When** the system processes the file
   - **Then** I want to see:
     * Total number of deliveries
     * Number of valid and invalid entries
     * Estimated total route distance
     * Potential optimization opportunities

### Route Optimization
3. As Maria, I want an intelligent route suggestion
   - **Given** I have a list of deliveries
   - **When** the system generates routes
   - **Then** I expect:
     * Grouped deliveries by geographic proximity
     * Estimated time and fuel savings
     * Recommended vehicle type for the route
     * Option to manually adjust suggested routes

4. As Carlos, I need flexible route management
   - **Given** an initial route suggestion
   - **When** I review the proposed routes
   - **Then** I can:
     * Add priority markers to specific deliveries
     * Manually override system suggestions
     * Save custom route configurations
     * Compare multiple routing options

### Reporting and Insights
5. As Maria, I want to track route efficiency
   - **Given** completed deliveries
   - **When** I access the system dashboard
   - **Then** I can see:
     * Actual vs. suggested route performance
     * Fuel and time savings
     * Delivery success rates
     * Trends in route optimization

6. As Carlos, I need comprehensive reporting
   - **Given** multiple delivery days
   - **When** I generate reports
   - **Then** I want insights on:
     * Driver performance
     * Route efficiency trends
     * Potential areas of improvement
     * Cost-saving opportunities
