# Route Optimization Complexity Levels

## 1. Basic Route Optimization
### Objective
Minimize total distance traveled

### Characteristics
- Simple point-to-point routing
- No time constraint considerations
- Single vehicle assumption

### Algorithms
- Nearest neighbor
- Simple greedy path selection

### Use Cases
- Very small delivery volumes
- No strict time commitments
- Minimal operational constraints

## 2. Intermediate Route Optimization
### Objective
Balance distance, time, and delivery constraints

### Characteristics
- Time window constraints
- Priority management
- Basic capacity planning
- Multiple vehicle considerations

### Additional Constraints
- Delivery time slots
- Vehicle load limits
- Priority delivery handling

### Algorithms
- Cluster-first, route-second approaches
- Basic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) solvers

### Use Cases
- Small to medium delivery businesses
- Predictable delivery patterns
- Some flexibility in routing

## 3. Advanced Route Optimization
### Objective
Comprehensive, dynamic routing intelligence

### Characteristics
- Real-time traffic integration
- Dynamic rerouting
- Complex constraint handling
- Predictive analytics

### Advanced Constraints
- Live traffic updates
- Weather conditions
- Driver availability
- Vehicle maintenance schedules
- Customer preference prediction

### Algorithms
- Machine learning-based routing
- Advanced metaheuristics 
  * Genetic algorithms
  * Ant colony optimization
- Real-time constraint satisfaction solvers

### Use Cases
- Large logistics operations
- High-stakes delivery services
- Extremely dynamic environments

## Recommended Approach
For most small to medium businesses (like our online florist partner), start with **Intermediate Route Optimization** and plan a clear path to Advanced optimization as the business scales.
