# Technical Design Workshop Minutes

## Attendees
- Engineering Manager
- Backend Engineer
- Frontend Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Product Manager

## Key Decisions

### Clustering Approach
- **Primary Algorithm**: Custom Go implementation
  * K-means variant
  * Geospatial clustering
- **Rationale**: 
  * Full control over algorithm
  * Predictable performance
  * Avoid dependency on external ML libraries
- **Performance Target**: Process 200 entries in < 5 seconds

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go (Gin/Echo framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Clustering**: Custom implementation
  * Leverage Go's performance
  * Avoid dependency on rapidly changing ML libraries
