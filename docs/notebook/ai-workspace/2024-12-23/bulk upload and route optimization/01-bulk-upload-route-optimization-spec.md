# Bulk Upload & Route Optimization Specification

## Context
- **Project**: Antar Delivery Intelligence Platform
- **Date**: 2024-12-23
- **Collaborators**: 

## Objectives
- Develop a comprehensive bulk upload and route optimization feature
- Solve merchant pain points in large-scale delivery management

## Initial Discussion Points
1. Target User Segments
   - [x] Small merchants
   - [ ] Large enterprises - not prioritized in the current scope
   - [x] Specific industry focus? - we have a partner who is anonline florist, specializing in the delivery of beautifully crafted artisan flowers

2. Bulk Upload Requirements
   - [x] Supported file formats - csv
   - [x] Maximum file size 
     * Soft limit: 1 MB 
     * Hard limit: 5 MB
     * Recommended row count: Up to 200 deliveries per upload
   - [x] Required columns - delivery id, latitude and longitude of pickup and dropoff points
   - [x] Data validation requirements
     * Delivery ID: 
       - Must be unique
       - Non-empty
       - Alphanumeric characters only
     * Latitude/Longitude:
       - Must be valid decimal numbers
       - Latitude range: -90 to 90
       - Longitude range: -180 to 180
   - [x] Error handling and reporting
     * Validation errors:
       - Provide detailed error messages
       - Highlight specific rows with issues
       - Option to download error report

       - Allow uploading valid rows even if some rows contain errors
       - Clear indication of processed vs. rejected entries

3. Route Optimization Scope
   - [x] Near real-time route optimization
   - [x] Interactive route refinement
   - [x] Incremental clustering and route suggestion
   - [x] Performance target: Sub-5 second processing for 200 entries

## Next Steps (in this workspace)
- [ ] Define detailed user stories
- [ ] Outline technical architecture
- [ ] Identify potential challenges

## Final Step
publish to docs/product

## Open Questions
- What specific pain points are we solving?
  - merchants with large volumes of deliveries - this is the main focus
  - complex route planning done manually - we have a partner who is an online florist. they have hundreds of deliveries per day. we need to solve this problem
- What level of route optimization complexity?
