## SECTION 01 78 00  
### BULK ROUTE OPTIMIZER - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING SPECIFICATIONS  

---

### 1.0 GENERAL  

#### 1.1 OVERVIEW  
The Bulk Route Optimizer is a Python-based application that generates optimized delivery routes from a user-uploaded CSV file containing destination coordinates. Each route minimizes deviations from the most efficient path (e.g., straight-line trajectory) while grouping destinations efficiently under constraints. Future iterations will integrate real-time traffic and weather data using machine learning, specifically graph neural networks (GNNs) and related architectures.

#### 1.2 GOALS AND DELIVERABLES  
- Provide optimized delivery routes with minimal detours.  
- Enable uploading and parsing of destination data in CSV format.  
- Allow configuration of routing parameters via a user-friendly UI.  
- Use Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) for classical routing calculations.  
- Generate foundational data for training advanced machine learning models.

### 2.0 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS  

#### 2.1 INPUT SPECIFICATIONS  
- **CSV Input**: The uploaded CSV file should contain:  
  - Column 1: `Destination_ID` (Unique identifier for each location).  
  - Column 2: `Latitude`.  
  - Column 3: `Longitude`.  
- **Pickup Location**: Defined statically (e.g., warehouse coordinates) but customizable later.  

#### 2.2 ROUTE GENERATION  
- **Base Algorithm**:  
  - Use OSRM API to compute travel times and distances between destinations and from the pickup point.  
  - Group destinations into clusters based on straight-line distance to the final drop-off point.  
  - Generate routes that minimize the total distance or detour from a straight trajectory.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Each route must contain no more than `N` destinations, configurable by the user.  
  - Allow configurations for max deviation thresholds in meters or percentage.  

#### 2.3 OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS  
- **Route Output**:  
  - CSV file with:  
    - `Route_ID` (Unique identifier for the route).  
    - `Destination_Sequence` (Ordered list of destinations).  
    - `Total Distance` (Meters or miles).  
  - Visualization in the UI using a map API (e.g., Leaflet, Google Maps).  

#### 2.4 USER CONFIGURATIONS  
- **Parameters via UI**:  
  - Maximum number of destinations per route.  
  - Tolerance for deviations (percentage or absolute).  
  - Route prioritization (e.g., minimize distance, balance load).

### 3.0 SYSTEM DESIGN  

#### 3.1 ARCHITECTURE  
- **Backend**: Python with Flask/Django for API and routing logic.  
- **Frontend**: React.js or similar for an interactive UI.  
- **Routing Engine**:  
  - OSRM hosted locally for low-latency requests.  
  - Modular integration for switching between classical and ML-based optimizers.  
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL for storing user preferences, routes, and historical data.  

#### 3.2 WORKFLOW  
1. User uploads a CSV file.  
2. System parses and validates the data.  
3. Optimizer computes routes using OSRM and clustering logic.  
4. Results are visualized and downloadable in CSV format.

### 4.0 FUTURE EXPANSIONS  

#### 4.1 MACHINE LEARNING INTEGRATION  
- Develop a dataset from classical routing results for supervised learning.  
- Train a GNN to predict routing paths given constraints (traffic, weather, etc.).  
- Allow dynamic re-routing with real-time data feeds (traffic APIs, weather).  

#### 4.2 SCALABILITY  
- Cloud deployment for handling large-scale datasets.  
- Parallel processing for multiple routing tasks.  

---

### 5.0 TESTING AND VALIDATION  

#### 5.1 FUNCTIONAL TESTING  
- Verify routing accuracy with sample datasets.  
- Test clustering logic for varying `N` and deviation tolerances.  

#### 5.2 PERFORMANCE TESTING  
- Measure API response times for OSRM requests under different loads.  

#### 5.3 USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING  
- Ensure UI intuitiveness with feedback from test users.  

---

### 6.0 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS  

#### 6.1 RELIABILITY  
- Ensure 99.9% uptime for hosted OSRM service.  

#### 6.2 PERFORMANCE  
- Optimize response time to <2 seconds per route generation for datasets with 100+ points.  

#### 6.3 SECURITY  
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.  
- Encrypt CSV uploads during transmission.  

#### 6.4 MAINTAINABILITY  
- Modular design for routing logic and ML integration.  
- Clear documentation for API and algorithmic components.
