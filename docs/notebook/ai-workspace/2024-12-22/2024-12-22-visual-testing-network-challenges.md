# Visual Testing Infrastructure: Network Navigation Challenges

## Problem Statement
Our visual testing infrastructure is experiencing consistent timeout and navigation failures when attempting to capture screenshots of documentation pages.

### Observed Symptoms
- Pages fail to load within the specified timeout (30-45 seconds)
- Intermittent network-related errors
- Inconsistent page capture behavior

## Diagnostic Approach

### Immediate Investigation Priorities
1. **Local Server Diagnostics**
   - Verify local server (localhost:8000) is running correctly
   - Check server response times
   - Validate server configuration

2. **Network Environment Analysis**
   - Examine network interface configurations
   - Investigate localhost resolution
   - Check for potential network interference

3. **Playwright Configuration**
   - Review browser context and page navigation settings
   - Analyze timeout and wait conditions
   - Investigate potential browser-specific issues

## Proposed Investigation Workflow

### Phase 1: Basic Diagnostics
- [ ] Manually verify all pages load correctly in a web browser
- [ ] Check local server startup process
- [ ] Validate mkdocs build process
- [ ] Run network diagnostics script

### Phase 2: Detailed Network Analysis
- [ ] Implement comprehensive network logging
- [ ] Capture detailed request/response metadata
- [ ] Analyze network request patterns
- [ ] Identify potential bottlenecks

### Phase 3: Browser and Playwright Configuration
- [ ] Experiment with different wait conditions
- [ ] Adjust timeout strategies
- [ ] Test with different browser types (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- [ ] Implement more granular error handling

## Timeout Strategy Investigation

### Hypothesis Development
1. **Minimal Timeout Hypothesis**
   - Objective: Understand page load characteristics under strict time constraints
   - Proposed Timeout: 3 seconds
   - Key Questions:
     - Which pages load within 3 seconds?
     - What are the common characteristics of quickly loading pages?
     - Are there systemic bottlenecks in page generation?

### Diagnostic Information Collection

#### Page Load Metrics
- [ ] Capture page load times
- [ ] Record successful vs. failed page captures
- [ ] Categorize pages by load time complexity

#### Detailed Metrics to Track
```
Page Path | Load Time | Status | Network Requests | Error Details
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
/index.html | 0.5s | Success | 12 requests | None
/tech/arch.html | 3.2s | Timeout | 45 requests | Network idle not reached
```

### Experimental Parameters
- **Base Timeout**: 3 seconds
- **Wait Condition**: 'networkidle'
- **Capture Strategy**: 
  - Sequential captures
  - Detailed logging
  - Minimal retry mechanism

### Investigative Workflow

#### Phase 1: Baseline Measurement
1. Run visual tests with 3-second timeout
2. Collect comprehensive logs
3. Analyze initial results
   - Identify percentage of pages loading
   - Categorize load time distributions

#### Phase 2: Comparative Analysis
- Compare results with manual browser loading
- Investigate discrepancies between automated and manual loading
- Identify potential environmental factors

### Potential Investigation Vectors

#### Network Layer
- [ ] Verify local server configuration
- [ ] Check network interface performance
- [ ] Analyze DNS resolution
- [ ] Investigate potential network bottlenecks

#### Page Generation
- [ ] Examine mkdocs build process
- [ ] Check for complex page generation logic
- [ ] Identify pages with heavy dynamic content

#### Browser Automation
- [ ] Test with different wait conditions
- [ ] Experiment with alternative navigation strategies
- [ ] Compare performance across browser types

### Logging and Tracing Strategy

#### Enhanced Logging Configuration
```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('visual_test_diagnostics.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
```

### Expected Outcomes
1. Comprehensive understanding of page load characteristics
2. Identification of systemic loading issues
3. Data-driven approach to timeout and loading strategies

### Risks and Limitations
- 3-second timeout is extremely aggressive
- May not capture full page loading complexity

## MkDocs Site Generation and Path Mapping

### Source to Build Path Transformation

MkDocs converts Markdown source files to HTML using a specific path transformation:

#### Path Mapping Examples
| Source Path (Markdown)                                     | Generated HTML Path                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `docs/index.md`                                           | `site/index.html`                                    |
| `docs/notebook/index.md`                                  | `site/notebook/index.html`                           |
| `docs/notebook/features/bulk-upload/index.md`             | `site/notebook/features/bulk-upload/index.html`      |
| `docs/tech/architecture.md`                               | `site/tech/architecture/index.html`                  |

### Key Transformation Rules
1. `.md` files are converted to `index.html`
2. Subdirectory structure is preserved
3. Root `docs/` directory maps to `site/`
4. Markdown filenames become `index.html`

### Capture Strategy Considerations
- Always use `index.html` for directory paths
- Preserve full subdirectory structure
- Handle potential nested directory scenarios

### Path Normalization Example
```python
def normalize_page_path(page_path):
    """
    Convert source Markdown path to generated HTML path
    
    Args:
        page_path (str): Original Markdown file path
    
    Returns:
        str: Corresponding HTML file path in site directory
    """
    # Remove .md extension
    html_path = page_path.replace('.md', '')
    
    # Ensure index.html for directories
    if not html_path.endswith('/index'):
        html_path += '/index'
    
    return f"{html_path}.html"
```

### Potential Capture Paths
- `notebook/features/bulk-upload/index.md` → `site/notebook/features/bulk-upload/index.html`
- `tech/architecture.md` → `site/tech/architecture/index.html`

### Debugging Path Issues
1. Verify source Markdown file existence
2. Check MkDocs build configuration
3. Validate site directory structure
4. Use logging to track path transformations

## MkDocs Site Directory Structure

### Directory Overview
The `site/` directory is generated by MkDocs and contains the fully built static documentation site. Its structure mirrors the source documentation layout:

```
site/
├── index.html                  # Root landing page
├── 404.html                    # Custom 404 error page
├── assets/                     # Static assets (CSS, JS)
├── notebook/                   # Notebook section
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── ai-workspace/           # Specific workspace documentation
│   ├── features/               # Feature documentation
│   └── process/                # Process documentation
├── tech/                       # Technical documentation section
├── product/                    # Product-related pages
├── we-and-ai/                  # AI-related documentation
├── search/                     # Search index and functionality
└── stylesheets/                # Custom styling
```

### Capture Strategy Considerations
- Each HTML file represents a rendered documentation page
- Subdirectories reflect the documentation's logical structure
- Static site generation ensures consistent rendering

### Filename Mapping
When capturing screenshots, we'll use a consistent mapping:
- `/notebook/ai-workspace/index.html` → `notebook_ai-workspace_index.png`
- `/tech/architecture.html` → `tech_architecture.png`

This approach ensures:
- Unique filename generation
- Easy traceability
- Filesystem-friendly naming

## Parallel Site Directory Screenshot Capture Strategy

### Overview
The parallel site directory screenshot capture is a robust method for generating visual tests across a complex documentation site structure. It addresses the challenges of capturing screenshots from a multi-level, statically generated documentation site.

### Key Design Principles
1. **Parallel Processing**: Utilize asynchronous processing to capture screenshots concurrently
2. **Semaphore-based Concurrency**: Limit simultaneous browser instances to prevent resource exhaustion
3. **Preserve Directory Structure**: Maintain the original site directory hierarchy in screenshot storage
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Capture screenshots for all HTML files recursively

### Implementation Strategy

#### Directory Traversal
- Start from the `site/` root directory
- Recursively walk through all subdirectories
- Identify and process `.html` files
- Skip non-HTML files and specific directories (e.g., `assets/`)

#### Capture Process
1. **File Discovery**
   - Use `os.walk()` to traverse directory tree
   - Filter for `.html` files
   - Preserve relative path information

2. **Screenshot Generation**
   - Use Playwright to render each HTML file
   - Capture full-page screenshots
   - Generate unique filenames based on original path

3. **Concurrency Management**
   - Implement asyncio Semaphore to control:
     * Maximum concurrent browser instances
     * Prevent system resource overload
     * Ensure predictable performance

### Potential Challenges and Mitigations
- **Large Directory Structures**: Use configurable concurrency limits
- **Rendering Variations**: Standardize viewport and browser settings
- **Performance Overhead**: Implement intelligent filtering and caching mechanisms

### Pseudocode Concept
```python
async def capture_site_screenshots(site_dir, max_concurrent=5):
    screenshots = []
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)
    
    async def process_html_file(file_path):
        async with semaphore:
            # Capture screenshot logic
            pass
    
    for root, _, files in os.walk(site_dir):
        html_files = [f for f in files if f.endswith('.html')]
        tasks = [process_html_file(os.path.join(root, file)) for file in html_files]
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

### Recommended Configuration
```python
VisualTester(
    site_directory='site/',
    max_concurrent_captures=10,
    viewport_size=(1280, 720),
    output_directory='.cascade/visual-test'
)
```

### Performance Considerations
- Adjust `max_concurrent_captures` based on system capabilities
- Monitor memory and CPU usage during large site captures
- Implement logging and metrics collection

### Future Enhancements
- Intelligent file filtering
- Incremental screenshot updates
- Differential visual testing

## Workaround Strategies

### Timeout Modification
   ```python
   # Increased timeout with more detailed error handling
   await page.goto(url, 
       wait_until='networkidle', 
       timeout=3000  # 3 seconds
   )
   ```

### Sequential Page Capture
   - Implement a sequential capture strategy instead of concurrent
   - Reduce parallel processing to minimize network contention

### Retry Mechanism
   ```python
   async def capture_with_retry(page_path, max_retries=3):
       for attempt in range(max_retries):
           try:
               # Capture logic
               return result
           except Exception as e:
               if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                   raise
               await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
   ```

## Comprehensive Workaround Strategy

## Workaround: Static HTML Snapshot Capture

### Core Workaround Strategy
When network-based page loading fails, we'll implement a filesystem-driven screenshot approach that bypasses traditional network rendering.

### Proposed Implementation

```python
async def capture_page_snapshot(page_path):
    """
    Capture page screenshot using alternative methods
    
    Workaround Strategies:
    - Direct file reading
    - Static HTML rendering
    - Fallback screenshot mechanisms
    """
    try:
        # Strategy 1: Direct HTML File Reading
        html_path = os.path.join('site', page_path)
        if os.path.exists(html_path):
            # Use a headless browser to render static HTML
            async with async_playwright() as p:
                browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
                context = await browser.new_context()
                page = await context.new_page()
                
                # Load file directly from filesystem
                await page.goto(f'file://{os.path.abspath(html_path)}')
                
                # Immediate screenshot, bypass network loading
                screenshot_path = f'.cascade/visual-test/{page_path.replace("/", "_")}.png'
                await page.screenshot(path=screenshot_path)
                
                await browser.close()
                return screenshot_path
        
        # Strategy 2: Fallback Rendering
        console.print(f"⚠️ Could not capture {page_path}")
        return None
    
    except Exception as e:
        console.print(f"❌ Snapshot capture failed: {e}")
        return None
```
