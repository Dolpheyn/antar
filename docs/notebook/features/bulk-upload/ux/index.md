## User Journey

Understanding how users interact with the system is crucial. We've mapped out a journey that guides them smoothly from file selection to final confirmation:

```mermaid
journey
    title Upload Journey
    section File Selection
      Choose file: 5: User
      Validate format: 3: System
      Show preview: 4: System
    section Processing
      Parse data: 3: System
      Validate addresses: 3: System
      Group routes: 4: System
    section Review
      View map: 5: User
      Adjust groups: 4: User
      Confirm: 5: User
```

### Journey Analysis
- **High Satisfaction Points (5)**
  - File selection: Simple, familiar interaction
  - Map view: Visual confirmation of data
  - Final confirmation: Clear completion
- **System Processes (3-4)**
  - Format validation: Quick, automated
  - Address verification: Background process
  - Route grouping: Intelligent assistance

## Interface Architecture

Our interface is built on three foundational principles: clarity, feedback, and control. Each component is designed to work seamlessly with others while maintaining its distinct purpose.

### Component Integration

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Primary Interface"
        A[Upload Zone] --> B[Data Preview]
        B --> C[Route Planning]
        C --> D[Confirmation]
    end
    
    subgraph "Support Systems"
        E[Error Prevention]
        F[Progress Tracking]
        G[Data Validation]
    end
    
    A --> E
    B --> F
    B --> G
    C --> G
    
    style A fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Component Details

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Upload Zone"
    A[Large Drop Area] --> B[Format Indicators]
    A --> C[Progress Bar]
    end
    
    subgraph "Processing View"
    D[Step Indicator] --> E[Error Display]
    D --> F[Time Estimate]
    end
    
    subgraph "Map Interface"
    G[Group Colors] --> H[Interactive Points]
    G --> I[Distance Lines]
    end
    
    style A fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Cross-Platform Experience

Our interface adapts seamlessly across devices while maintaining functionality and usability.

### Responsive Design Strategy

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Desktop"
    A[Full Interface] --> B[Advanced Controls]
    end
    
    subgraph "Tablet"
    C[Hybrid Layout] --> D[Touch + Pointer]
    end
    
    subgraph "Mobile"
    E[Progressive UI] --> F[Touch Optimized]
    end
    
    style A fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Mobile Optimizations
