# Route Grouping Engine: Optimization Strategies

## Core Algorithm Design

The route grouping engine transforms raw delivery data into optimized, efficient routes through a sophisticated multi-stage process.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Raw Orders] -->|Distance Matrix| B[Initial Groups]
    B -->|Optimization| C[Refined Groups]
    C -->|Constraints| D[Final Routes]
    
    style A fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## TypeScript Interface

```typescript
interface RouteGroupProps {
  orders: Order[];
  groupingStrategy: GroupingStrategy;
  constraints: RouteConstraints;
  onGroupingComplete: (groups: OrderGroup[]) => void;
}
```

## Optimization Dimensions

### 1. Distance Minimization
- Euclidean distance calculations
- Nearest neighbor clustering
- Dynamic route recalculation

### 2. Time Window Constraints
- Delivery time preferences
- Vehicle capacity limits
- Priority order handling

### 3. Cost Efficiency
- Fuel consumption modeling
- Route length optimization
- Minimal vehicle switching

## Machine Learning Integration
- Predictive route suggestions
- Historical performance analysis
- Continuous algorithm improvement

## Performance Metrics
- Average route efficiency
- Grouping computation time
- Constraint satisfaction rate
