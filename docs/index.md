    C -->|Optimization| D[Smart Routes]
    D -->|Analysis| E[Provider Matching]
    end
    
    subgraph "Execution Layer"
    E -->|Integration| F[Provider Network]
    F -->|Tracking| G[Delivery Status]
    end

    style F fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#9cf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Platform Architecture

Our system is built on three core layers that work together seamlessly:

```mermaid

    subgraph "Client Layer"
    A[Order Management] --> B[Route Visualization]
    B --> C[Provider Selection]
    end
    
    subgraph "Processing Layer"
    D[Data Validation] --> E[Route Optimization]
    E --> F[Provider Matching]
    end
    
    subgraph "Integration Layer"
    G[Provider APIs] --> H[Status Tracking]
    H --> I[Analytics Engine]
    end

```

## Core Capabilities

### Intelligent Route Optimization

Our sophisticated routing system transforms complex delivery scenarios into efficient routes:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Input Processing"
    A[CSV Upload] -->|Validation| B[Data Cleaning]
    B -->|Analysis| C[Initial Groups]
    end
    
    subgraph "Optimization"
    C -->|Algorithm| D[Route Formation]
    D -->|Refinement| E[Final Routes]
    end
    
    subgraph "Execution"
    E -->|Assignment| F[Provider Dispatch]
    F -->|Monitoring| G[Status Updates]
    end
    
    style A fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Key features include:
- Advanced grouping algorithms for optimal route formation

    C[Provider 3] --> D
    end
    
    subgraph "Smart Matching"
    D -->|Analysis| E[Cost Optimization]
    D -->|Routing| F[Time Windows]
    D -->|Coverage| G[Service Areas]
    end
    
    style A fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
