# Phase 1: Foundation Initiative

## Overview
In the bustling cities of Southeast Asia, thousands of deliveries happen every day. Yet, businesses struggle with the complexity of managing bulk orders efficiently. Phase 1 of Antar represents our first step in transforming this landscape, starting with a strategic partnership that will validate our technology and business model.

> "Building an Intelligent Multi-Route Optimization Platform for Bulk Deliveries"

This phase focuses on developing our core platform capabilities to handle bulk delivery operations, with emphasis on route optimization and time-sensitive deliveries. Our initial implementation will serve a retailer in Malaysia, setting the foundation for broader market adoption.
