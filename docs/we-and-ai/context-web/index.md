## Context Loading Rules

1. **Always Start Fresh**: Reload contexts for each new task
2. **Load in Order**: Follow the sequence in task patterns
3. **Keep Updated**: Check for context updates regularly
4. **Cross-Reference**: Use multiple contexts when needed

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with high-level context
2. **Drill Down**: Move to specific details as needed
3. **Stay Current**: Keep contexts in mind throughout task
4. **Update When Needed**: Contribute new insights back to contexts
