# Project Areas Context Definition

## Core Concepts
Project development follows a natural progression from abstract (ideas, concepts) to concrete (specifications, tasks). Each area represents a distinct phase in this progression while maintaining interconnected relationships.

## Area Definitions and Relationships

### 1. Story Idea [Abstract Layer]
**PRIMARY FUNCTION:** Conceptualization and Vision
**KEY ASPECTS:**
- Problem Definition and Validation
- User-Centric Narrative Development
- Innovation Space Exploration
- Future Evolution Pathways

**RELATIONSHIPS:**
- Feeds into → Project Roadmap (shapes strategic direction)
- Influences → Technical Roadmap (informs technical possibilities)
- Impacts → Task Management (drives priority decisions)

### 2. Project Roadmap [Strategic Layer]
**PRIMARY FUNCTION:** Strategic Planning and Direction
**KEY ASPECTS:**
- Phase Structuring and Milestone Definition
- Success Metrics Framework
- Resource Planning Strategy
- Adaptive Planning Mechanisms

**RELATIONSHIPS:**
- Derives from ← Story Idea (vision alignment)
- Guides → Technical Roadmap (implementation sequence)
- Structures → Task Management (timeline framework)
- Influences → Technical Specifications (requirement priorities)

### 3. Technical Roadmap [Architecture Layer]
**PRIMARY FUNCTION:** Technical Strategy and Evolution
**KEY ASPECTS:**
- Technology Stack Decision Framework
- System Architecture Evolution
- Integration Strategy Development
- Scaling and Growth Planning

**RELATIONSHIPS:**
- Implements ← Project Roadmap (strategic guidance)
- Details → Technical Specifications (architectural constraints)
- Informs → Task Management (technical dependencies)

### 4. Technical Specifications [Implementation Layer]
**PRIMARY FUNCTION:** Detailed System Definition
**KEY ASPECTS:**
- Component Requirements Documentation
- Interface Definitions
- Security and Performance Standards
- Quality Assurance Framework

**RELATIONSHIPS:**
- Guided by ← Technical Roadmap (architectural boundaries)
- Defines → Task Management (implementation details)
- Validates ← Story Idea (technical feasibility)

### 5. Task Management [Execution Layer]
**PRIMARY FUNCTION:** Work Organization and Tracking
**KEY ASPECTS:**
- Task Breakdown and Dependencies
- Progress Monitoring Systems
- AI-Driven Timeline Adaptation
- Resource Optimization

**RELATIONSHIPS:**
- Implements ← Technical Specifications (work items)
- Guided by ← Project Roadmap (strategic priorities)
- Adapts to ← Story Idea (vision alignment)

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Temporal Aspect:** All areas evolve over time through AI-driven mutations
- **Dependency Management:** Each area influences and is influenced by others
- **Feedback Loops:** Implementation insights flow back to inform higher-level areas
- **Adaptability:** All areas support dynamic adjustment based on new information

## Usage in Conversations
When discussing project areas, consider:
1. Current context layer (Abstract → Execution)
2. Relevant relationships between areas
3. Impact of changes across layers
4. Temporal state and evolution potential
