# Our Development Process

## Context-Driven Development

Our development process is built on the foundation of rich, interconnected context that informs every decision and action.

### The Context Web

```

## How Context Shapes Development

### 1. Discovery Phase

!!! example "Context Gathering"
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Market Research] --> E[Context Pool]
        B[User Feedback] --> E
        C[Tech Trends] --> E
        D[Business Goals] --> E
        E --> F[Analysis]
        F --> G[Insights]
    ```

- Automated monitoring of industry news
- User feedback collection and analysis
- Technical trend tracking
- Business objective alignment

### 2. Analysis Phase

!!! example "Semantic Processing"
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Raw Data] --> B[Classification]
        B --> C[Relationship Mapping]
        C --> D[Priority Scoring]
        D --> E[Action Items]
    ```

- Pattern recognition
- Impact assessment
- Priority determination
- Relationship mapping

### 3. Implementation Phase

!!! example "Context-Aware Development"
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Context] --> B[Design]
        B --> C[Development]
        C --> D[Testing]
        D --> E[Deployment]
        E --> A
    ```

- Context-informed design decisions
- AI-assisted development
- Automated testing
- Continuous feedback

## Creating Contexts

When working with AI, contexts are crucial for ensuring consistent and well-informed decisions. Follow these guidelines when creating new contexts:

### Context Structure
1. **Clear Purpose**
   - What problem does this context solve?
   - Who will use it?
   - When should it be used?

2. **Core Components**
   - Header with title and purpose
   - Key concepts and definitions
   - Relationship mappings
   - Implementation guidelines

3. **Writing Style**
   - Clear, unambiguous language
   - Consistent terminology
   - Practical examples
   - Progressive disclosure
