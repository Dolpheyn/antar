# AI Knowledge Context Creation Guide

## Purpose
AI Knowledge Contexts serve as foundational understanding frameworks that help AI systems better comprehend and operate within specific domains of the project. They provide structured information that influences AI decision-making and responses.

## Context Structure Guidelines

### 1. Core Components

#### Header Section
- Clear title identifying the context domain
- Brief overview of the context's purpose
- Timestamp of last update

#### Conceptual Framework
- Key concepts and their definitions
- Fundamental principles
- Critical assumptions

#### Relationship Mapping
- Internal relationships within the context
- External connections to other contexts
- Dependency chains and influence flows

#### Implementation Impact
- How this context affects decision-making
- Practical application guidelines
- Success metrics and evaluation criteria

### 2. Writing Style

#### Clarity
- Use precise, unambiguous language
- Define technical terms when first used
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout

#### Structure
- Use hierarchical organization
- Include clear section headers
- Employ bullet points for key items

#### Completeness
- Cover all essential aspects
- Address edge cases and exceptions
- Include relevant examples

### 3. Context Types

#### Domain Contexts
- Define specific knowledge areas
- Outline domain-specific rules
- Document special considerations

#### Process Contexts
- Describe workflows and procedures
- Define decision points
- Specify success criteria

#### Relationship Contexts
- Map interactions between components
- Define integration points
- Document dependencies

## Best Practices
