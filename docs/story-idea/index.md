# Story Idea Phase

!!! info "What is a Story Idea?"
    A Story Idea is the starting point of any project - it's where we capture the initial spark of inspiration and shape it into something concrete. Think of it like sketching out a rough map before starting a journey.

## For Those New to Project Development
If you're new to this, think of a Story Idea as answering these simple questions:
1. What problem are we trying to solve?
2. Why does this problem matter?
3. How might we solve it?

For example, our delivery aggregator project started with a simple observation: "Malaysian merchants struggle to manage multiple delivery services efficiently."

## For Product Managers and Business Analysts
The Story Idea phase helps structure your initial product vision through:
- Problem statement definition
- Market opportunity analysis
- Value proposition development
- Initial user persona identification

## For Technical Teams
This phase provides crucial context for technical planning:
- System boundaries and constraints
- Integration requirements
- Technical challenges to consider
- Scalability considerations

!!! tip "Remember"
