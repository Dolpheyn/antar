# Documentation Deployment Workflow
#
# This workflow automatically builds and deploys our documentation to GitHub Pages.
# It runs on:
# - Every push to main (builds and deploys)
# - Every pull request (builds only)
#
# Features:
# - Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
# - Preview builds for pull requests
# - Mermaid diagram support
# - Dependency caching for faster builds
#
# Setup Required:
# 1. Go to repository Settings > Pages
# 2. Under "Build and deployment":
#    - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
#
# The documentation will be available at:
# https://[username].github.io/the-project/
