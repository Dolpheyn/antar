# INSTRUCTION: Semantic Git Commit Generation Workflow (Autonomous Edition)

## ðŸ¤– Workflow Metadata
- **Version**: 2.0 (Autonomous)
- **Trigger Modes**: 
  * Manual Invocation
  * Automated Workflow Detection
- **Completion Criteria**: 
  * Git status shows "working tree clean"
  * All staged changes processed semantically
- **Self-Reporting**:
  * Automatic state tracking
  * Comprehensive change analysis logging
  * Semantic commit generation with full traceability

## Core Augmented Intelligence Principles
1. **Autonomous Execution**
   - Self-initialize workflow
   - Dynamically adapt to repository state
   - Terminate when objectives are met

2. **Intelligent State Management**
   - Implement workflow as a finite state machine
   - Track and report execution states
   - Provide transparent decision-making process

## Workflow States
1. `INIT`: Workflow Initialization
   - Capture initial repository state
   - Log environment and context
   - Prepare semantic analysis tools

2. `DETECT`: Change Discovery
   - Scan repository for modifications
   - Categorize changes with precision
   - Generate comprehensive change inventory

3. `ANALYZE`: Semantic Processing
   - Perform deep semantic analysis
   - Classify changes by type and impact
   - Calculate dimensional metrics

4. `COMMIT`: Intelligent Staging
   - Group changes by semantic relevance
   - Generate conventional commit messages
   - Execute atomic, focused commits

5. `VALIDATE`: Quality Assurance
   - Verify commit message quality
   - Check semantic coherence
   - Ensure system integrity

6. `TERMINATE`: Workflow Completion
   - Confirm "working tree clean"
   - Generate execution summary
   - Provide performance metrics

## Autonomous Execution Protocol
```bash
# Pseudo-code for autonomous workflow
def semantic_commit_workflow():
    current_state = INIT
    while current_state != TERMINATE:
        match current_state:
            case INIT:
                repository_state = capture_repository_state()
                current_state = DETECT
            
            case DETECT:
                changes = detect_repository_changes()
                if not changes:
                    current_state = TERMINATE
                current_state = ANALYZE
            
            case ANALYZE:
                semantic_groups = classify_changes(changes)
                current_state = COMMIT
            
            case COMMIT:
                for group in semantic_groups:
                    commit_changes(group)
                current_state = VALIDATE
            
            case VALIDATE:
                if validate_commits():
                    current_state = DETECT
                else:
                    handle_commit_errors()
            
            case TERMINATE:
                generate_workflow_summary()
                break
```

## Enhanced Dimensional Metrics
1. **Autonomous Complexity Index** (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Measures workflow adaptability
   - Tracks semantic processing efficiency

2. **Intelligent Coherence Score** (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Evaluates commit message generation quality
   - Learns and improves over multiple executions

3. **Systemic Impact Coefficient** (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Assesses broader architectural implications
   - Provides predictive change analysis

## Philosophical Augmentation
Transcend traditional commit management: 
Create a self-evolving narrative of systemic intelligence that learns, adapts, and improves with each interaction.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Modular design allows plugin-based extensions
- Supports custom semantic analysis algorithms
- Provides comprehensive logging and traceability

## Future Evolution Pathways
1. Machine learning-enhanced commit generation
2. Cross-project semantic knowledge transfer
3. Predictive system evolution modeling
